# Building documentation

This documentation is built with doxygen and doxygen awesome css running the `doxygen` in the base directory of this project. If you don't have doxygen installed, install version 1.9.\* from the [Doxygen website](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/install.html). The documentation should then be located at docstemp(listed in .gitignore) and you can open index.html to view the docs.
